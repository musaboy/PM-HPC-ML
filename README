I designed this model to predict house prices in Chicago based on various property features, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, size, tax, and condition of the house. To achieve this, I used Linear Regression as a baseline for comparison and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) as the primary model to maximize predictive accuracy. Additionally, I implemented a Random Forest Regression model to further enhance predictive performance.
